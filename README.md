# React and ThreeJS PizzaBuilder!
Files for my React Pizza Builder website, built using React and ThreeJS, which can be accessed here: http://react-pizza-builder.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/

This is a basic little web application that creates a mockup pizza in ThreeJS using React Components. It was designed as a way to test and show my react knowledge, and build a little web app that does something fun.
May not run perfectly accross all browsers and video cards (the .glb file is fairly large for a web3d application).

Future planned updates include a username/password to be able to save your favorite pizzas (similar to Dominos Pizza Profile), asset & rendering optimization, and improved animations for "delivery" and "pickup"
